> Position filled on July 2020

We are an R&D performing startup, pursuing a breakthrough in **Accurate and affordable navigation solutions**. We work mostly developing algorithms and software related to satellite navigation 🛰️ (GNSS), but we aim also at exploring other technologies (WiFi, 5G, Ultra wideband, ...). Also, we sometimes get our hands dirty and play with hardware in case it's useful for showcasing our technologies 🔩

As of today, the automotive 🚗 and Location Based Services 📱 are actively looking for navigation solutions that are scalable and can offer sub-metric accuracy. After a few years generating proprietary navigation technology on his own, Rokubun is getting there!

Rokubun is now mature enough to take off and scale-up to hit these markets with novel and innovative navigation solutions. But to achieve this goal we need people like you! We are currently expanding as a result of the combination of a seed round and an European GNSS Agency R&D grant and our administrative load is growing fast!

So yes! We are looking for an **administrative assistant** (back office) for our office in Barcelona, Spain.

## What will you do

You will work in a dynamic team of software and navigation engineers, helping us in the day-to-day administrative stuff that needs to be done to keep the company gears ⚙️⚙️⚙️ running smoothly. In particular:

- Organize incoming and outgoing invoices 🧾 and Interface with our Accountant Service.
- Interface with our Legal and labour service on a need basis.
- Documentary organization and maintenance.

- Help project managers to organize paperwork for project related activity: send contracts for signature, organize required paperwork for audits and justification, ...

- Organize shipping of Rokubun hardware to customers or manage the purchase and payment of equipment.

### In 1 month

You will get to know the team, how we work, which tools we use and you will know our methods to keep the company organized.

You should be already used to our methodology and start organizing our paperwork. Maybe you will start finding points in our back-office administration that could be improved.

### From 6 months onward

You are actively contributing to keep the office administration and back-office well organized and proposing potential improvements.

## How are you going to do it

We are still small, so you will closely work with the CEO and CTO and, most probably, with a team of 3 to 4 engineers and project managers as well.

We hold weekly *stand-up meetings* to check what each team member is doing, which problems she/he faced, etc. This keeps the team cohesive and helps the task progress. Sometimes, great ideas pop up in those meetings as well.
