> Position filled on July 2020

We are an R&D performing startup, pursuing a breakthrough in **Accurate and affordable navigation solutions**. We work mostly developing algorithms and software related to satellite navigation üõ∞Ô∏è (GNSS), but we aim also at exploring other technologies (WiFi, 5G, Ultra wideband, ...). Also, we sometimes get our hands dirty and play with hardware in case it's useful for showcasing our technologies üî©

As of today, the automotive üöó and Location Based Services üì± are actively looking for navigation solutions that are scalable and can offer sub-metric accuracy. After a few years generating proprietary navigation technology on his own, Rokubun is getting there!

Rokubun is now mature enough to take off and scale-up to hit these markets with novel and innovative navigation solutions. But to achieve this goal we need people like you! We are currently expanding as a result of the combination of a seed round and an European GNSS Agency R&D grant.

So yes! We are looking for a **navigation software engineer** for our office in Barcelona, Spain.

## What will you do

You will work in a dynamic team of software and navigation engineers and help us to improve **Rokubun's location stack**, in particular:

- contribute to our processing core (written in C and some bits in C++), that takes care of the heavy-lifting (GNSS signal modeling, processing filter, parsers, ...)
- create bindings in Python for our processing core. This will add functionality and extend [Jason](https://jason.rokubun.cat), our Positioning-as-a-Service.
- create bindings in Java/Kotlin (Android) for our smartphone-based applications such as [QuickSurv](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cat.rokubun.quicksurv).
- GNSS measurements, specially those coming from smartphones, will need to be analyzed so that better data editing and processing strategies can be developed. Do you think you can take care of this too? If you think this is daunting, don't worry, we can help.

### In 1 month

You will get to know the team, how we work, how we code and which are the projects we currently have ongoing.

If you need to refresh some concepts on GNSS data analysis, we can point you to some useful material. Believe it or not, there is lots of great stuff for free out there.

### In 3 months

You will be familiar with the code we have implemented so far. It is likely that you will  be up to speed and already contribute with great ideas and brilliant software.

### From 6 months onward

You may feel that the work we do and the projects we have already cover your needs in terms of what you want to do and learn at Rokubun. Or maybe something is still itching and would like to find some funding for this breaking idea üí° you had last week in your üõÄüöø. We can help you find funding opportunities and assist in the proposal preparation (we do this all the time). On one condition: the topic should be aligned at what we do at Rokubun ‚û°Ô∏è "Accurate and affordable navigation".

## How are you going to do it

We are still small, so you will closely work in a team of 3 to 4 engineers that has already developed a great deal of algorithms and software for Rokubun's Location Stack and its Positioning-as-a-Service platform.

We hold weekly *stand-up meetings* to check what each team member is doing, which problems she/he faced, etc. This keeps the team cohesive and helps the task progress. Sometimes, great ideas pop up in those meetings as well.

As a mid-level engineer, and despite having regular meetings, we expect some autonomy in your day-to-day work.

## Who will you be working with

- [Miquel Garcia-Fernandez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miquelgarcia/) (CTO and co-founder), GNSS engineer and software developer
- [Alex Lopez-Cruces](https://es.linkedin.com/in/alexlopezcruces), Rokubun's lead
  sotware engineer and DevOps architect.

## Where will you work

In our offices at [Barcelona, near Gl√≤ries](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/41.40255/2.19455), but we will move by Q4 2020 to other offices (likely around Pla√ßa Espanya, south Barcelona)

## Which skills are we looking for

- You are familiar with GNSS signal observables and navigation algorithms
- You may have a Ph.D. or M.S. degree that is somehow related to the tasks you will be performing (e.g. electrical engineering, computer science, physics, ...). We are asking this because we do not want you feel daunted if you need to look for information in scientific papers or technical reports.
- Strong programming skills (C/C++, Python).
- You know the meaning of words/expressions like *memory leak*, *coverage test*,
   *commit*, *single responsibility principle*, *K.I.S.S.*, ...
- Some knowledge in Android programming.
- Applies best practices in version control software (we extensively use `git`).
- Fluent in English. Additional languages will be valuable.

Regarding soft skills, keep in mind that:

- we highly value **curiosity**.
- we embrace **positive criticism**, we know we are not perfect and that there is always a better way to do things.

## What do we offer

- A mid-level engineering position within Rokubun
- Salary range: 30k‚Ç¨ ~ 38k‚Ç¨
- 27 holidays per year
- **flexible working hours**, the only thing we ask is that you show up during our core hours: from 10h to 15h
- Having a good rest helps stay productive, that is why we offer **37.5 hours per week** instead of 40.
- **Remote work** once per week (yes, you will be able to work in slippers)
- Permanent contract, after 6 months test period
- Professional growth within an expanding company in a highly dynamic sector. Is there any workshop or conference you'd like to attend? We are all ears. Do you have in mind a formation üë©‚Äçüéì opportunity of your interest? Let us know and we will try to accommodate it.
- ‚òï and üç™ are on us!
