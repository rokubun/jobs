> Position filled on October 2020

We are an R&D performing startup, pursuing a breakthrough in **Accurate and affordable navigation solutions**. We work mostly developing algorithms and software related to satellite navigation üõ∞Ô∏è (GNSS), but we aim also at exploring other technologies (WiFi, 5G, Ultra wideband, ...). Also, we sometimes get our hands dirty and play with hardware in case it's useful for showcasing our technologies üî©

As of today, the automotive üöó and Location Based Services üì± are actively looking for navigation solutions that are scalable and can offer sub-metric accuracy. After a few years generating proprietary navigation technology on his own, Rokubun is getting there!

Rokubun is now mature enough to take off and scale-up to hit these markets with novel and innovative navigation solutions. But to achieve this goal we need people like you! We are currently expanding as a result of the combination of a seed round and an European GNSS Agency R&D grant.

So yes! We are looking for a **program manager and business developer** for our office in Barcelona, Spain.

## What will you do

You will work in a dynamic team of software and navigation engineers, in charge of program management and contributing to business development, in particular:

- be in charge of managing our portfolio of R&D projects with the goal of exploiting synergies and aligning outcomes to meet our business strategy.
- have a relevant role in business development activities within the scope of the managed projects and beyond in close collaboration with Rokubun‚Äôs business management.
- Create, propose and manage long-term goals.
- Develop a budget and operating plan for the program.
- Drive the communication and dissemination projects activities in a consistent synergetical manner.
- Develop an evaluation method to assess program strengths and identify areas for improvement.
- Contribute in the preparation of funding proposals to guarantee uninterrupted delivery of services.
- Ensure goals are met in areas including customer satisfaction, safety, quality and team member performance.
- Implement and manage changes and interventions to ensure project goals are achieved.
- Meet with stakeholders to make communication easy and transparent regarding project issues and decisions on services.
- Produce accurate and timely reporting of program status throughout its life cycle.

We hold weekly *stand-up meetings* to check what each team member is doing, which problems she/he faced, etc. This keeps the team cohesive and helps the task progress. Sometimes, great ideas pop up in those meetings as well.
