We are an R&D performing startup, pursuing a breakthrough in **Accurate and affordable navigation solutions**. We work mostly developing algorithms and software related to satellite navigation üõ∞Ô∏è (GNSS), and also with other technologies (IMU, WiFi, 5G, Ultra wideband, ...). Also, we sometimes get our hands dirty and play with hardware in case it's useful for showcasing our technologies üî©

Automotive üöó  and Location Based Services üì± are actively looking for navigation solutions that are scalable and can offer sub-metric accuracy. After a few years generating proprietary navigation technology on his own, Rokubun is getting there! We are currently expanding as a result of the combination of a seed round and various European GNSS Agency R&D grants.

We are looking for a **navigation engineer** for our office in Barcelona, Spain.

## What will you do

You will, first and foremost, help us extend our **location stack** to cover not only GNSS data modelling and processing for navigation but also hybridization of GNSS with IMU, WiFi and UWB RTT ranges and other technologies. You will:

- Devise, implement and refine navigation algorithms to hybridize GNSS ranges with: (a) other ranging data (WiFi or UWB RTT) and (b) accelerometer/gyro data from Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) (loosely and tightly coupling hybridization)
- Work with raw GNSS measurements and data coming from smartphones to achieve a better location.
- Plan and execute test campaigns to test our current location stack as well as to challenge your algorithms and assess its performance.
- Perform data (mostly WiFi RTT ranges, ... ) analysis to assess its quality and identify its limitations (multipath, biases, ... ). This will help us improve the model capabilities of this data.
- Contribute to technical reports (regarding hybrid navigation) for the different projects ongoing at Rokubun (state-of-the-art definition, algorithm description, ...).

The output of your work will be used to:

- contribute to our processing core (written in C and some bits in C++), that takes care of the heavy-lifting (GNSS signal modeling, processing filter, parsers, ...)
- create bindings in Python for our processing core. This will add functionality and extend [Jason](https://jason.rokubun.cat), our Positioning-as-a-Service.

### In 1 month

You will get to know the team, how we work, how we code and which are the projects we currently have ongoing.

You will get acquainted with the code we have implemented so far.


### In 3 months

This position expects some degree of seniority in GNSS data processing, therefore you might be able to be up to speed and already contribute with great ideas and brilliant software.

### From 6 months onward

You may feel that the work we do and the projects we have already cover your needs in terms of what you want to do and learn at Rokubun. Or maybe something is still itching and would like to find some funding for this breaking idea üí° you had last week in your üõÄüöø. We can help you find funding opportunities and assist in the proposal preparation (we do this all the time). On one condition: the topic should be aligned at what we do at Rokubun ‚û°Ô∏è "Accurate and affordable navigation".

## How are you going to do it

You will closely work in a team of 3 to 4 navigation engineers that have already developed a great deal of algorithms and software for Rokubun's Location Stack and its Positioning-as-a-Service platform.

We hold weekly *stand-up meetings* to check what each team member is doing, which problems she/he faced, etc. This keeps the team cohesive and helps the task progress. Sometimes, great ideas pop up in those meetings as well.

As a mid-level engineer, and despite having regular meetings, we expect some autonomy in your day-to-day work.

## Who will you be working with

- [Miquel Garcia-Fernandez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miquelgarcia/) (CTO and co-founder), GNSS engineer and software developer
- [Alex Lopez-Cruces](https://es.linkedin.com/in/alexlopezcruces), Rokubun's lead
  sotware engineer and DevOps architect.

## Where will you work

In our new offices at [Barcelona Activa, near Gl√≤ries](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/41.40614/2.19250), Barcelona (Spain).

## Which skills are we looking for

- You have experience in GNSS signal observables and navigation algorithms
- You are familiar with Inertial sensors and hybridization with GNSS data or, at least, you have an interest to learn it. Note that this will be you main responsibility.
- You may have an M.S. degree that is somehow related to the tasks you will be performing (e.g. electrical engineering, computer science, physics, mathematics...).
- Comfortable reading scientific journals and technical reports.
- Experience with estimation theory (e.g. Kalman filter)
- You are proficient in C and (ideally) familiar with Python.
- Applies best practices in version control software (we extensively use `git`).
- Fluent in English. Additional languages will be valuable.

Regarding soft skills, keep in mind that:

- we highly value **curiosity**.
- we embrace **positive criticism**, we know we are not perfect and that there is always a better way to do things.

## What do we offer

- A mid-level engineering position within Rokubun
- Salary range: 30k‚Ç¨ ~ 38k‚Ç¨
- 27 holidays per year
- **flexible working hours**, the only thing we ask is that you show up during our core hours: from 10h to 15h
- Having a good rest helps stay productive, that is why we offer **37.5 hours per week** instead of 40.
- **Remote work** once per week (yes, you will be able to work in slippers)
- Permanent contract, after 6 months test period
- Professional growth within an expanding company in a highly dynamic sector. Is there any workshop or conference you'd like to attend? We are all ears. Do you have in mind a formation üë©‚Äçüéì opportunity of your interest? Let us know and we will try to accommodate it.
- ‚òï and üç™ are on us!
