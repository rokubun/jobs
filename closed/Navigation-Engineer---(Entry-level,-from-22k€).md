We are an R&D performing startup, pursuing a breakthrough in **Accurate and affordable navigation solutions**. We work mostly developing algorithms and software related to satellite navigation üõ∞Ô∏è (GNSS), and also with other technologies (IMU, WiFi, 5G, Ultra wideband, ...). Also, we sometimes get our hands dirty and play with hardware in case it's useful for showcasing our technologies üî©

Automotive üöó  and Location Based Services üì± are actively looking for navigation solutions that are scalable and can offer sub-metric accuracy. After a few years generating proprietary navigation technology on his own, Rokubun is getting there! We are currently expanding as a result of the combination of a seed round and various European GNSS Agency R&D grants.

We are looking for a recently graduated **engineer interested in starting a career in satellite navigation** for our office in Barcelona, Spain.

## What will you do

You will, first and foremost, help us improve and extend our **location stack**. In practice, this means that you will:

- Add new features to our GNSS navigation processing engine, written in C: support
  new data formats (i.e. process NTRIP stream, multiplex data coming from
  different sources/receivers, ...), add new capabilities, improve the
  performance of our engine, ...
- Help us implement the newest Galileo Open Service
  Navigation Message Authentication (OS-NMA), one of the latest additions to the
  Galileo system service portfolio to give protection against signal spoofing.
- Get familiar with the Galileo High Accuracy Service (HAS) and support our team to
  implement it.
- Install and test our processing engine in embedded platforms such as the
  application processor of our receiver, Raspberry Pi, ...
- Help us with various test campaign (data gathering, processing and analysis)
  related to, for instance, GNSS + WiFi hybridization.
- Support the team with processing data sets from various navigation related projects.
- Contribute to technical reports (related to GNSS navigation) for the different 
  projects ongoing at Rokubun (state-of-the-art definition, algorithm description, ...).


The output of your work will be used to:

- extend and improve our GNSS processing engine with Python bindings
- add functionality and extend [Jason](https://jason.rokubun.cat), our Positioning-as-a-Service in the cloud.
- add features to our smartphone-based applications such as [QuickSurv](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cat.rokubun.quicksurv).

### In 1 month

You will get to know the team, how we work, how we code and which are the projects we currently have ongoing.

If you need to refresh (or get acquainted to) some concepts on GNSS data analysis, we can point you to some useful material and teach one or two things ourseves.

### In 3 months

You will be familiar with the code we have implemented so far. It is likely that you will  be up to speed and already contribute with great ideas and brilliant software.

### From 6 months onward

You will contribute both on the software development side as well as executing
test campaigns and process the data generated with those campaigns.

It might be also that you start consider upgrading your degree to a master (MSc) or even a PhD. We will encourage to do so (we even have the academic connections)!

## How are you going to do it

We are still small, so you will closely work in a team of 3 to 4 engineers that has already developed a great deal of algorithms and software for Rokubun's Location Stack and its Positioning-as-a-Service platform. You will help these
engineers with software development as well as learn the tools of the trade
at the same time.

We hold weekly *stand-up meetings* to check what each team member is doing, which problems she/he faced, etc. This keeps the team cohesive and helps the task progress. Sometimes, great ideas pop up in those meetings as well.

## Who will you be working with

- [Miquel Garcia-Fernandez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miquelgarcia/) (CTO and co-founder), GNSS engineer and software developer
- [Alex Lopez-Cruces](https://es.linkedin.com/in/alexlopezcruces), Rokubun's lead
  sotware engineer and DevOps architect.

## Where will you work

In our new offices at [Barcelona Activa, near Gl√≤ries](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/41.40614/2.19250), Barcelona (Spain).

## Which skills are we looking for

This is an entry-level position, therefore we do not expect you to be a 
full-fledged navigation engineer or software developer. We will value, above all, 
your disposition to learn satellite navigation technology. These are some basic 
requirements that we are looking for:

- You have a degree related to the tasks you will be performing at Rokubun (e.g. 
  electrical engineering, computer science, physics, mathematics...)
- Ideally, when achieving your degree, you took a course on GNSS and satellite navigation. If so, the music will already sound familiar to you.
- Have a solid mathematical background (you will need it to be acquaited with Kalman filtering and estimation theory)
- You have some programming skills (e.g. Python) and you are not afraid of getting hands dirty with a lower level programming language such as **C**.
- You like tinkering with data and are curious on how navigation works in smartphones.
- Comfortable reading scientific journals and technical reports.
- Fluent in English. Additional languages will be valuable.

Regarding soft skills, keep in mind that:

- we highly value **curiosity**.
- we embrace **positive criticism**, we know we are not perfect and that there is always a better way to do things.

## What do we offer

- An entry-level engineering position within Rokubun
- Salary range: 22k‚Ç¨ ~ 29k‚Ç¨ (depending on your experience)
- 27 holidays per year
- **flexible working hours**, the only thing we ask is that you show up during our core hours: from 10h to 15h
- Having a good rest helps stay productive, that is why we offer **37.5 hours per week** instead of 40.
- **Remote work** once per week (yes, you will be able to work in slippers)
- Permanent contract, after 6 months test period
- Professional growth within an expanding company in a highly dynamic sector. Is there any workshop or conference you'd like to attend? We are all ears. Do you have in mind a formation üë©‚Äçüéì opportunity of your interest? Let us know and we will try to accommodate it.
- ‚òï and üç™ are on us!
