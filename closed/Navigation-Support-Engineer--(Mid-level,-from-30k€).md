> Position filled on July 2020

We are an R&D performing startup, pursuing a breakthrough in **Accurate and affordable navigation solutions**. We work mostly developing algorithms and software related to satellite navigation üõ∞Ô∏è (GNSS), but we aim also at exploring other technologies (WiFi, 5G, Ultra wideband, ...). Also, we sometimes get our hands dirty and play with hardware in case it's useful for showcasing our technologies üî©

As of today, the automotive üöó and Location Based Services üì± are actively looking for navigation solutions that are scalable and can offer sub-metric accuracy. After a few years generating proprietary navigation technology on his own, Rokubun is getting there!

Rokubun is now mature enough to take off and scale-up to hit these markets with novel and innovative navigation solutions. But to achieve this goal we need people like you! We are currently expanding as a result of the combination of a seed round and an European GNSS Agency R&D grant.

So yes! We are looking for a **navigation support and pre/post sales engineer** for our office in Barcelona, Spain.

## What will you do

You will work in a dynamic team of software and navigation engineers, help us to improve the service and experience of [Jason](https://jason.rokubun.cat), our GNSS processing platform in the cloud, in particular:

- Sometimes Jason does not behave as expected and users get wrong results, we need you to help us identify the problem so that the navigation engineers can implement the necessary fixes.
- Evaluate customer needs in terms of GNSS data processing. What are they missing from Jason? What would they like to have implemented? What are the new features that can generate new customers? The feedback you gather from this will be forwarded to Rokubun's engineers.
- Engage new users to our platform.
- Maintain and expand our database of GNSS products (satellite orbits and clocks, CORS network)
- Occasionally we would like also you to help us perform data campaigns: gather GNSS data, process it, write reports on the results obtained, ...
- Benchmark the different options in a given processing strategy to reach the optimal strategy configuration for a given scenario (for instance, automotive, pedestrian, smartphone, geodetic-grade receiver, ...)
- Sometimes, we might ask you to help us with some small software implementation to e.g. validate some results.

### In 1 month

You will get to know the team, how we work, which tools we use and you will know the guts of Jason.

We will also connect you with Jason "hotline" and will start receiving mails from users.

### In 3 months

You will start responding to users, hopefully with some good news that their issue has been identified and fixed.

### From 6 months onward

You are actively contributing to expand Jason in terms of number of users as well as number of features that increase the added value of the platform. You are identifying problems in Jason such as: problem fetching PPP corrections, GNSS measurements from reference stations, ... Also, you might be contributing with new ideas boosting our portfolio of ‚û°Ô∏è "Accurate and affordable navigation" solutions

## How are you going to do it

We are still small, so you will closely work in a team of 3 to 4 engineers that will support you in solving the issues found by users and collaborate with the business team in charge of expanding Jason's customers. 

We hold weekly *stand-up meetings* to check what each team member is doing, which problems she/he faced, etc. This keeps the team cohesive and helps the task progress. Sometimes, great ideas pop up in those meetings as well.

As a mid-level engineer, and despite having regular meetings, we expect some autonomy in your day-to-day work.

## Who will you be working with

- [Xavier Banqu√©-Casanovas](https://es.linkedin.com/in/xavierbanque) (CEO and co-founder), research engineer and business developer.
- [Miquel Garcia-Fernandez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miquelgarcia/) (CTO and co-founder), GNSS engineer and software developer
- [Alex Lopez-Cruces](https://es.linkedin.com/in/alexlopezcruces), Rokubun's lead
  sotware engineer and DevOps architect.

## Where will you work

In our offices at [Barcelona, near Gl√≤ries](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/41.40255/2.19455), but we will move by Q4 2020 to other offices (likely around Pla√ßa Espanya, south Barcelona)

## Which skills are we looking for

- Knowledgeable with GNSS processing strategies (PPP, RTK) and data analysis.
- Experience with GNSS software, particularly RTKLIB, but other software and online services as well.
- You may have a Ph.D. or M.S. degree that is somehow related to the tasks you will be performing (e.g. electrical engineering, computer science, physics, ...). We are asking this because we do not want you feel daunted if you need to look for information in scientific papers or technical reports.
- Some basic programming skills in Python and/or command line scripting (e.g. `bash`)
- Fluent in English. Additional languages will be valuable.
 
Regarding soft skills, keep in mind that:

- we highly value **curiosity**.
- analytic mindset.
- we embrace **positive criticism**, we know we are not perfect and that there is always a better way to do things.

## What do we offer

- A mid-level engineering position within Rokubun
- Salary range: 30k‚Ç¨ ~ 38k‚Ç¨
- 27 holidays per year
- **flexible working hours**, the only thing we ask is that you show up during our core hours: from 10h to 15h

- **Remote work** once per week (yes, you will be able to work in slippers)
- Permanent contract, after 6 months test period
- Professional growth within an expanding company in a highly dynamic sector. Is there any workshop or conference you'd like to attend? We are all ears. Do you have in mind a formation üë©‚Äçüéì opportunity of your interest? Let us know and we will try to accommodate it.
