We are an R&D performing startup, pursuing a breakthrough in **Accurate and affordable navigation solutions**. We work mostly developing algorithms and software related to satellite navigation üõ∞Ô∏è (GNSS), but we aim also at exploring other technologies (WiFi, 5G, Ultra wideband, ...). Also, we sometimes get our hands dirty and play with hardware in case it's useful for showcasing our technologies üî©

As of today, the automotive üöó and Location Based Services üì± are actively looking for navigation solutions that are scalable, robust and can offer sub-metric accuracy. After a few years generating proprietary navigation technology on his own, Rokubun is getting there!

Rokubun is now mature enough to take off and scale-up to hit these markets with novel and innovative navigation solutions. But to achieve this goal we need people like you! We are currently expanding as a result of the combination of a seed round and an European GNSS Agency R&D grant.

So yes! We are looking for a **software developer** for our office in Barcelona, Spain.

## What will you do

You will work in a dynamic team of software and navigation engineers and help us to improve **Rokubun's location stack**, in particular:

- Develop and maintain our navigation **services in the cloud**, such as [Jason](https://jason.rokubun.cat), our Positioning-as-a-Service.
- Are you interested in **Machine Learning**? Great! we have several ongoing projects related to the application of Machine Learning for navigation applications
- We also need to maintain our internal software development tools, such as our Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment pipelines.

### In 1 month

You will get to know the team, how we work, how we code and which are the projects we currently have ongoing.

### In 3 months

You will be familiar with the code we have implemented so far. It is likely that you will be up to speed and already contribute with great ideas and brilliant software.

### From 6 months onward

You may feel that the work we do and the projects we have already cover your needs in terms of what you want to do and learn at Rokubun. Or maybe something is still itching and would like to find some funding for this breaking idea üí° you had last week in your üõÄüöø. We can help you find funding opportunities and assist in the proposal preparation (we do this all the time). On one condition: the topic should be aligned at what we do at Rokubun ‚û°Ô∏è "Accurate and affordable navigation".

## How are you going to do it

You will closely work in a team of 3 to 4 engineers that has already developed a great deal of algorithms and software for Rokubun's Location Stack and its Positioning-as-a-Service platform.

We hold weekly *stand-up meetings* to check what each team member is doing, which problems she/he faced, etc. This keeps the team cohesive and helps the task progress. Sometimes, great ideas pop up in those meetings as well. In addition, you will have one-to-one meetings with your direct supervisor to solve blocking points, development issues, ...

## Who will you be working with

- [Miquel Garcia-Fernandez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miquelgarcia/) (CTO and co-founder), GNSS engineer and software developer
- [Alex Lopez-Cruces](https://es.linkedin.com/in/alexlopezcruces), Rokubun's lead sotware engineer and DevOps architect.

## Where will you work

In our offices at [Barcelona, near Gl√≤ries](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/41.40255/2.19455), but we will move by Q4 2020 to other offices (likely around Pla√ßa Espanya, south Barcelona)

## Which skills are we looking for

- Curiosity and willingness to explore: A proactive and inquisitive mindset, with a predisposition to tinker with things and explore new technologies or approaches.
- Familiarity with cloud services. We will need your help in managing our projects currently deployed in the cloud.
- You know the meaning of words/expressions like *memory leak*, *coverage test*,
   *commit*, *single responsibility principle*, *K.I.S.S.*, ...
- Applies best practices in version control software (we extensively use `git`).
- Fluent in English. Additional languages will be valuable.

Regarding soft skills, keep in mind that:
