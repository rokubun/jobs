We are an R&D performing scale-up, pursuing a breakthrough in **Accurate and affordable navigation solutions**.
We work mostly developing algorithms and software related to satellite navigation üõ∞Ô∏è (GNSS),
but we aim also at exploring other technologies (WiFi, 5G, Ultra wideband, ...)
as well as recent developments in Galileo differentiators (High Accuracy Service,
Open Service-Navigation Message Authentication, ...)

As of today, the automotive üöó and Location Based Services üì± are actively looking
for navigation solutions that are scalable and can offer sub-metric accuracy.
After a few years generating proprietary navigation technology on our own, we are
getting there!

Rokubun is now mature enough to take off and scale-up to hit these markets with
novel and innovative navigation solutions. But to achieve this goal we need people
like you! We are currently expanding to scale up the company. Our JASON cloud service for precise navigation information is the maiden solution we aim at boosting first.

So yes! We are looking for a **JASON Key Account and Growth Hacker**  for our office in Barcelona, Spain.
