> Position filled on February 2021

We are an R&D performing startup, pursuing a breakthrough in **Accurate and affordable navigation solutions**. We work mostly developing algorithms and software related to satellite navigation üõ∞Ô∏è (GNSS), but we aim also at exploring other technologies (WiFi, 5G, Ultra wideband, ...).

As of today, the automotive üöó and Location Based Services üì± are actively looking for navigation solutions that are scalable and can offer sub-metric accuracy. After a few years generating proprietary navigation technology on his own, Rokubun is getting there!

We are currently expanding as a result of the combination of a seed round and an European GNSS Agency R&D grant. To grow our team, we are looking for a **developer interested in starting a career in front-end and API** development for our office in Barcelona, Spain.

## What will you do

You will, first and foremost, contribute to improve the user interface and user
experience (UI/UX) of our data processing platform in the cloud ([Jason](https://jason.rokubun.cat)) and, to some extent, some DevOps activities. You will:

- Extend Jason with newer capabilities, this will imply back-end (extension of
  its Application Programming Interface) and front-end development.
- We will also ask you to help us integrate new programs (mostly executables
  written in C or Python libraries) into our services in the cloud.
- Help our team of developers to build APIs (Python, node.js) to bring our new
  products and services into the cloud.
- You will also get your hands dirty deploying our services into the cloud
  (Amazon Web Services, Google cloud)
- We will ask you to build several static web pages to showcase our ongoing
  projects.

### In 1 month

You will get to know the team, how we work, how we code and which are the projects we currently have ongoing.

### In 3 months

You will be familiar with the code we have implemented so far. It is likely that you will be up to speed and already contribute with great ideas and brilliant software.

### From 6 months onward

At this stage, you will be 100% integrated at Rokubun, working closely with the team and, most likely, refining code and procedures in our software development and DevOps practices. Visible results from your contributions will surely pop up.

## How are you going to do it

We are still small, so you will closely work in a team of 3 to 4 engineers that has already developed a great deal of algorithms and software for Rokubun's Location Stack and its Positioning-as-a-Service platform.

We hold weekly *stand-up meetings* to check what each team member is doing, which problems she/he faced, etc. This keeps the team cohesive and helps the task progress. Sometimes, great ideas pop up in those meetings as well.
