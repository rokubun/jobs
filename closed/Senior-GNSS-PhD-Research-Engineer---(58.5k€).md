Rokubun is an R&D performing startup, pursuing a breakthrough in **Accurate and affordable navigation solutions**. We work mostly developing algorithms and software related to satellite navigation (GNSS), but we aim also at exploring other technologies (WiFi, 5G, Ultra wideband, IMU, ...). Also, we sometimes get our hands dirty and play with hardware in case it's useful for showcasing our technologies

As of today, the automotive and Location Based Services are actively looking for navigation solutions that are scalable and can offer sub-metric accuracy. After a few years generating proprietary navigation technology on his own, Rokubun is getting there!

Rokubun is now mature enough to take off and scale-up to hit these markets with novel and innovative navigation solutions. But to achieve this goal we need people like you! We are currently expanding as a result of the combination of a seed round and an European GNSS Agency R&D grant.

So yes! We are looking for a **navigation Senior GNSS Engineer** (holding a PhD) that is willing to help us develop *Affordable and accurate geolocation solutions*. Rokubun will make the application of your candidacy to the [TecnioSpring Programme](http://catalonia.com/innovate-in-catalonia/tecniospringplus/tecniospringdescription.jsp). A summary of conditions are included below.

Please note that the **deadline to apply to this position is June 2021**. The starting position, if the proposal is accepted, will be between October 2021 and April 2022. If not filled, we might be able to apply in June 2022.

## What will you do

You will develop your work within a dynamic team of software and navigation engineers. The output of your work will help us to improve **Rokubun's location stack**, in particular:

- Develop navigation algorithms and techniques for advanced GNSS data processing for navigation (e.g. uncombined and undifferenced processing engine, multi-station GNSS data processing, application of Galileo High Accuracy Service and other Precise Point Position corrections, implementation of Open Service-Navigation Message Authentication, ...)
- Develop algorithms to achieve the best possible accuracy possible in mass-market GNSS devices (smartphones, affordable GNSS chipsets from e.g. u-blox, ST microelectronics, ...)
- contribute to our processing core (written in C and some bits in C++), that takes care of the heavy-lifting (GNSS signal modeling, processing filter, ...)
- create bindings in Python for our processing core. This will add functionality and extend [Jason](https://jason.rokubun.cat), our Positioning-as-a-Service.

Despite these tasks, as a Senior GNSS receiver you will play a key role in the definition of Rokubun navigation technology portfolio. Do you want to propose a specific set of tasks aligned with the concept of *Affordable and accurate geolocation*? We are all ears! Let us know your ideas!


### In 1 month

You will get to know the team, how we work, how we code and which are the projects we currently have ongoing.

### In 3 months

You will be familiar with the code we have implemented so far. It is likely that you will be up to speed and already contribute with great ideas and brilliant software.

### From 6 months onward

You may feel that the work we do and the projects we have already cover your needs in terms of what you want to do at Rokubun. Or maybe something is still itching and would like to find some funding for this breaking idea you had last week in your bath. We can help you find funding opportunities and assist in the proposal preparation (we do this all the time). On one condition: the topic should be aligned at what we do at Rokubun "Accurate and affordable navigation".

## How are you going to do it

We are still small, so you will closely work in a team of 3 to 4 engineers that has already developed a great deal of algorithms and software for Rokubun's Location Stack and its Positioning-as-a-Service platform.

We hold weekly *stand-up meetings* to check what each team member is doing, which problems she/he faced, etc. This keeps the team cohesive and helps the task progress. Sometimes, great ideas pop up in those meetings as well.
