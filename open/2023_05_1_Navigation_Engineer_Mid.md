We are an R&D performing scale-up, pursuing a breakthrough in
**Accurate and affordable navigation solutions**. We work mostly developing
algorithms and software related to satellite navigation üõ∞Ô∏è (GNSS), and also with
other technologies (IMU, WiFi, 5G, Ultra wideband, ...). We are also involved
in the development of user-level applications that make use of recent Galileo
differentiators (High Accuracy Service, Open Service-Navigation Message
Authentication)

Automotive üöó  and Location Based Services üì± are actively looking for navigation
solutions that are scalable and can offer sub-metric accuracy. After a few years
generating proprietary navigation technology on our own, we are getting there!

In short, we are looking for a **navigation engineer** for our office in Barcelona, Spain.

## What will you do

You will, first and foremost, contribute to and extend Rokubun's **positioning engine**,
in particular:

- Design, implement and refine navigation algorithms for GNSS
- Work with raw GNSS measurements and data coming from smartphones or our own receiver
  (based on the u-blox ZED-F9P chipset) to achieve a better location.
- Plan and execute test campaigns to test our current location stack as well as
  to challenge your algorithms and assess its performance.
- Perform data analysis to assess its quality and identify its limitations
  (multipath, biases, ... ).
- Contribute to technical reports for the different projects ongoing at Rokubun
  (state-of-the-art definition, algorithm description, ...).
- Propose new navigation concepts and lead proposals to fund them

The output of your work will be used to:

- contribute to our processing core (written in C and Python), that takes care of
  the heavy-lifting (GNSS signal modeling, processing filter, parsers, ...)
- create bindings in Python for our processing core. This will add functionality
  and extend [Jason](https://jason.rokubun.cat), our Positioning-as-a-Service.

### In 1 month

You will get to know the team, how we work, [how we code](how-we-code)
and which are the projects we currently have ongoing.

You will get acquainted with the code we have implemented so far.

### In 3 months

This position expects some degree of seniority in GNSS data processing, therefore
you might be able to be up to speed and already contribute with great ideas and
brilliant software.

### From 6 months onward

You may feel that the work we do and the projects we have already cover your needs
in terms of what you want to do and learn at Rokubun. Or maybe something is still
itching and would like to find some funding for this breaking idea üí° you had last
week in your üõÄüöø. We can help you find funding opportunities and assist in the
proposal preparation (we do this all the time). On one condition: the topic should
be aligned at what we do at Rokubun ‚û°Ô∏è "Accurate and affordable navigation".

## How are you going to do it

You will closely work in a team of 3 to 4 navigation engineers that have already
developed a great deal of algorithms and software for Rokubun's Location Stack
and its Positioning-as-a-Service platform.

We hold weekly *stand-up meetings* to check what each team member is doing, which
problems she/he faced, etc. This keeps the team cohesive and helps the task progress.
Sometimes, great ideas pop up in those meetings as well.

As a mid-level engineer, and despite having regular meetings, we expect some
autonomy in your day-to-day work.

## Who will you be working with

- [Miquel Garcia-Fernandez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miquelgarcia/) (CTO and co-founder), GNSS engineer and software developer
- [Alex Lopez-Cruces](https://es.linkedin.com/in/alexlopezcruces), Rokubun's lead
  sotware engineer and DevOps architect.

## Where will you work

In our new offices at [Barcelona Activa, near Gl√≤ries](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/41.40614/2.19250), Barcelona (Spain).

## Which skills are we looking for

- You have experience in GNSS signal observables, range modeling, raw measurement
  analysis and navigation algorithms.
- You may have an M.S. degree that is somehow related to the tasks you will be
  performing (e.g. electrical engineering, computer science, physics, mathematics...).
- Comfortable reading scientific journals and technical reports.
- Experience with estimation theory (e.g. Kalman filter)
- You are proficient in C and (ideally) familiar with Python.
- Applies best practices in version control software (we extensively use `git`).
- Fluent in English. Additional languages will be valuable.

Regarding soft skills, keep in mind that:

- we highly value **curiosity**.
- we embrace **positive criticism**, we know we are not perfect and that there is
  always a better way to do things.

## What do we offer

- A mid-level engineering position within Rokubun
- Salary range from 38k‚Ç¨
- 27 holidays per year
- **flexible working hours**, the only thing we ask is that you show up during our core hours: from 10h to 15h
- Having a good rest helps stay productive, that is why we offer **37.5 hours per week** instead of 40.
- **Remote work** once per week (yes, you will be able to work in slippers)
- Permanent contract, after 6 months test period
- Professional growth within an expanding company in a highly dynamic sector.
  Is there any workshop or conference you'd like to attend? We are all ears.
  Do you have in mind a formation üë©‚Äçüéì opportunity of your interest? Let us know
  and we will try to accommodate it.
- ‚òï and üç™ are on us!

a couple of references at [jobs@rokubun.cat](jobs@rokubun.cat). Use the reference
