We are an R&D performing startup, pursuing a breakthrough in **Accurate and affordable navigation solutions**.
We work mostly developing algorithms and software related to satellite navigation üõ∞Ô∏è (GNSS),
and also with other technologies (IMU, WiFi, 5G, Ultra wideband, ...).
Also, we sometimes get our hands dirty and play with hardware in case it's useful for showcasing our technologies üî©

Automotive üöó  and Location Based Services üì± are actively looking for navigation
solutions that are scalable and can offer sub-metric accuracy. After a few years
generating proprietary navigation technology on his own, Rokubun is getting there!

To scale up our products we are looking for an **engineer interested in software engineering for embedded systems**
for our office in Barcelona, Spain.

## What will you do

You will, first and foremost, help us integrate and extend our **location stack**
so that we can run it into embedded platforms. In practice, this means that you will:

- cross-compile our programs so that they can run in different embedded platforms.
- make the necessary amendments to the code to ensure a smooth cross-compilation.
- refactor our codebase written in C to make sure that is compliant with standards
such as MISRA our ASIL-B.

### In 1 month

You will get to know the team, how we work, how we code and which are the projects we currently have ongoing.
You will also get acquainted with our hardware platforms.

### In 3 months

You will be familiar with the code we have implemented so far and the platforms
we usually work with. It is likely that you will be up to speed and already
contribute with great ideas and brilliant software.

### From 6 months onward

You will be an active member developing new code and provide critical review
of new code.

## How are you going to do it

You will closely work in a team of 3 to 4 engineers that has already developed a
great deal of algorithms and software for Rokubun's Location Stack.
You will help these engineers with software development as well as learn the tools
of the trade at the same time.

We hold weekly *stand-up meetings* to check what each team member is doing, which
problems she/he faced, etc. This keeps the team cohesive and helps the task progress.
Sometimes, great ideas pop up in those meetings as well.

## Who will you be working with

- [Aleix Tejada-Gimenez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleixtejada/), Rokubun's lead hardware and firmware engineer.
- [Alex Lopez-Cruces](https://es.linkedin.com/in/alexlopezcruces), Rokubun's lead sotware engineer and DevOps architect.
- [Miquel Garcia-Fernandez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miquelgarcia/) (CTO and co-founder), GNSS engineer and software developer

## Where will you work

In our new offices at [Paral¬∑lel 88](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/6072806752), Barcelona (Spain).

## Which skills are we looking for

We are looking, above all, for someone that **considers himself a tinkerer and maker**.
But a list of specific skills  we are looking for are:

- You have an engineering degree related to the tasks you will be performing at Rokubun (e.g.
  electrical engineering, computer science, ...)
- Embedded hardware does not scare you.
- You aware of what is inside a chip, what is an operating system, a kernel and know the limitations of embedded platforms.
- You are comfortable working in low level languages such as C and are not afraid of the words *pointer* or *memory leak*.
You embrace the dangers attached to this freedom because you value the power that those languages bring to your hands.
- Tools such as GDB sound familiar to you.
- You have or would like to have an aptitude for debugging and troubleshooting
embedded system software, especially where IDE tools aren't available.
- You have a basic knowledge of serial protocols (UART, I2C, SPI), timing requirements and memory requirements.
- You feel capable of reading component technical documentation (datasheets. algorithm description) and extracting all relevant information.
Moreover, for algorithms, you are curious to figure out the most efficient way to implement it
considering the constraints of embedded platforms (no dynamic memory allocation,
limited computational speed, tight input/output interfaces, ...)
- You are fluent in English. If you have read this far down the job req. is already a good sign üòâ

Is all of this a piece of cake for you? All right! go on with the bonus points,
which will be greatly valued and will in fact determine the salary scale:

- Understanding on how satellite navigation (GNSS) technology works
- Experience and familiarity of automotive industry, in particular coding standards
and software qualification for the road market.

## What do we offer

- Salary range: 25k‚Ç¨ ~ 35k‚Ç¨ (depending on your experience and, in particular, on
the fulfillment of the bonus points mentioned above)
- 27 holidays per year
- **flexible working hours**, the only thing we ask is that you show up during our core hours: from 10h to 15h
- Having a good rest helps stay productive, that is why we offer **37.5 hours per week** instead of 40.
- **Remote work** three days every 2 weeks
- Permanent contract, after 6 months test period
- Professional growth within an expanding company in a highly dynamic sector.
Is there any workshop or conference you'd like to attend? We are all ears.
Do you have in mind a formation üë©‚Äçüéì opportunity of your interest?
Let us know and we will try to accommodate it.
- ‚òï and üç™ are on us!
