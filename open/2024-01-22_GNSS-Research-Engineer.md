# GNSS Research engineer

Rokubun is an R&D performing startup, pursuing a breakthrough in **Accurate and affordable navigation solutions**. We work on positioning technology. Mostly satellite navigation (GNSS), but we aim also at exploring other technologies (WiFi, 5G, Ultra wideband, IMU, ...). We also have hardware platforms such as the MEDEA GNSS computer (albeit we do not mass-produce it), a commodity we use to develop, test and showcase our technologies.

As of today, the automotive and Location Based Services are actively looking for navigation solutions that are scalable and can offer sub-metric accuracy. After a few years generating proprietary navigation technology on his own, Rokubun is getting there!

We are looking for a **navigation Senior GNSS Engineer** (holding a PhD) that is willing to help us develop *Affordable and accurate geolocation solutions*. Rokubun will make the application of your candidacy to the [Torres Quevedo Programme](https://www.aei.gob.es/convocatorias/buscador-convocatorias/ayudas-contratos-torres-quevedo-ptq-2023). A summary of conditions are included below.

Please note that the **deadline to apply to this position is February 2024**. The starting position, if the proposal is accepted, will be between July 2024 and September 2024 (approx. 6 months after the deadline).

## What will you do

You will develop your work within a dynamic team of software and navigation engineers. The output of your work will greatly depends on your interests as researcher, but some ideas related to improve **Rokubun's location stack** are:

- Develop navigation algorithms and techniques for advanced GNSS data processing for navigation (e.g. uncombined and undifferenced processing engine, application of Galileo High Accuracy Service and other Precise Point Position corrections, ...)
- Develop algorithms to achieve the best possible accuracy possible in mass-market GNSS devices (smartphones, affordable GNSS chipsets from e.g. u-blox, ST microelectronics, ...)
- Position integrity models for critical applications such as automotive or rail.

As a Senior GNSS receiver you will play a key role in the definition of Rokubun navigation technology portfolio and Rokubun expects you, as senior researcher, to propose specific set of tasks aligned with the concept of *Affordable and accurate geolocation*.

### In 1 month

You will get to know the team, how we work, how we code and which are the projects we currently have ongoing.

### In 3 months

You will be familiar with the technology we have implemented so far. It is likely that you will be up to speed and already contribute with ideas and software.

### From 6 months onward

You may feel that the work we do and the projects we have already cover your needs in terms of what you want to do at Rokubun. Or maybe you would like to find some funding for specific ideas you have in mind. We can help you find funding opportunities and assist in the proposal preparation as long as the topic is aligned at what we do at Rokubun: "Accurate and affordable navigation".

## How are you going to do it

You will closely work in a team of 3 to 4 engineers that has already developed a great deal of algorithms and software for Rokubun's Location Stack and its Positioning-as-a-Service platform.

We hold weekly *stand-up meetings* to check what each team member is doing, which problems she/he faced, etc. This keeps the team cohesive and helps the task progress. Sometimes, great ideas pop up in those meetings as well.
